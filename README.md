# Base-Converter
A C program that converts a number of base b to a number of a new base. 

The program can only process int type numbers with int type bases. If the target base or the user's number is not base 10, the program first converts the user's number to base 10 as an intermediate step to converting to the actual desired base. 

The output demonstrates the process of the conversion so the user will be able to replicate the process by hand, or can simply understand how the conversion works.
